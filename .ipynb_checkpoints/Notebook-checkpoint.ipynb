Rather than staring uninspired at the item in your fridge, our NLPChef will help you decide what to do with them! Not only can this model generate original, realistic, and fun recipes, it can do so based on a list of ingredients you have available. Simply tell the model what you have in your fridge, and it will generate a recipe based on what you have available. Or if you don't feel like giving the model inputs yourself, some example recipes (with corresponding ingredient list) can be found in the AllRecipes.txt file\n",

    "Now that we have the test and training datasets, we can train our model on this specific data. This task, however, is rather complicated: and cannot be performed solely in this notebook. Rather, we upload the TrainingData.txt to Google Colab. Then, we use the [run_lm_finetuning.py](https://github.com/alontalmor/pytorch-transformers/blob/master/examples/run_lm_finetuning.py) script from huggingface and define a bashscript run_experiments.sh to run it and to start training our model on the defined training data. run_lm_finetuning.py contains a number of errors, specifically with importing WarmupLinearSchedule from transformers. Therefore, we define our own WarmupLinearSchedule in the run_lm_finetuning.py, and use run_experiments.sh to train the custom model on our recently created training data. \n",

For the sake of inclusivity, our entire trained model is also available [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlUeI82AcSLCo41KNfOUS5dTqT0tEQ?e=4Wyq21)"
