    "I had some inspiration for a potentially novel approach to take this model in: reinforcement learning. While the current model already performs relatively well on creating sensical recipe texts, the model still has absolutely no idea of 'taste', and which ingredients work well together and which don't. Therefore, it may be desireable to give the model some sort of loss function score on its recipes so it knows which recipes are good and which are bad, so the model can improve.\n",
    "We could do this by either reading the recipes and rating them on how good we think they might be, or maybe even try to cook some of the things our model suggests and see how well they work, so we can help the model improve. While this may take some time and make the coding harder, it could be really cool to have a recipe generation model trained and optimized on actual real-world cooking, and I can hardly imagine anyone has ever done something like that before. Who knows, maybe the model will actually end up becoming a really good cook"
