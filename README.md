# NLPChef
Creating a text recognition program that can understand recipes from cookbooks. The dataset that we will use will probably come from the googlebooks library when we filter it on cookbooks. The goal for the project is not only to make a model that "understands" the recipes but that can also make up his own combining the knowledge gained from the training. We will try to divide the tasks equally. For example one can do the preparation of the dataset while the others work on making a model that trains with that data.
