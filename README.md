# NLPChef

## Abstract
The goal of this project is creating a text recognition program that can understand recipes from cookbooks, and create its own recipes based on its training from the corpus. 

## Research Objective
To create an assortment of recipes generated by an Artificial Intelligence and see how well they would work in the real world

## Dataset
For possible datasets, we have 2 ideas so far:
1. Using the Google Books Library and filtering on cookbooks. This would yield a plethora of information, but possibly also provide more difficult web scraping.
2. Another possiblity may be found in the use of open source recipe managers. If we can access the data uploaded to these recipe managers this may provide very valuable corpora: https://opensource.com/life/15/11/organize-your-cooking-open-source-recipe-manager 

## Milestones
We haven't yet created a definitive task division, as we believe that this is subject to change and we will perform most of the task collaboratively by helping each other. We have, however, defined a tangible list of milestones we intend to achieve:
1. Data acquisition
2. Data organization
3. Vectorizing, lemmatization
4. Traning the algorithm to understand existing recipes
5. Making the algorithm capable of generating new recipes
