 Instructions: Wash the pot  with 2 tablespoons water  and set  to steam in the pot with a large spatula (you will need to use the same hand to mix, but it's just a regular brush)  and season with salt and pepper, with a pinch of salt and a pinch of paprika.  Once you get the desired consistency,  mix the soup in the pot and  mix in the onion and bell peppers.  This will take about 15 minutes.  Make sure you  don't  get so much out of the pot because you'll be making a mess. After about ten minutes, you're ready to serve.

Add the tomatoes and cook for 3 more minutes more, or until the beans are all cooked down, but not mush. Remove the lid and stir it.     Add the rice.     Add 1 cup of soy sauce.

Add a dollop of the soy sauce, but avoid over stirring.
I used all-purpose flour, but if you can, you can easily make a little smaller bowl of this stuff on a baking sheet. I used about 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour in place of 2 teaspoons of all-purpose flour.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream 2 teaspoons of water and 1 cup of soy sauce.      Add the egg and whisk until well combined and combined.     Add the flour and cream.      Mix until combined.       Add the cream and mix.      Add the soy sauce.     Add the egg again.      Add the soy sauce.     Add the flour and stir.      Stir the cream and whisk until well combined.     Use a spatula to scrape any bubbles.       Mix until well combined.      Add the soy sauce to the bowl and mix.      Add the whole-bag of ingredients.     Mix until thoroughly combined.     Add a dollop of the soy sauce.       Add the dollop of the water.      Add the soy sauce and the egg, and stir to combine.
