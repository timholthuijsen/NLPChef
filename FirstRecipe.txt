You could try the pasta without the salt, but you'll likely just try it on its own. It's pretty easy and inexpensive, especially since it's made from scratch.
Coriander on the side: A couple of minutes of fresh coriander leaves to set on top of the base.
A slightly salty side of this sauce would be better.
Toppings [ edit ]
2 cups tomatoes, rinsed and cut into pieces.
Sea salt to taste.
1 cup spaghetti.
Spicy dressing: pickled onions, chopped scallions, crushed red peppers, crushed black olives (or other meat you prefer) to taste.
Method and Preparation [ edit ]
Drain out and put in the freezer for about 2 to 4 hours. Once it's done, add a dollop of sauce and mix it down. The pasta will start to go mushy and when you add it all over, it becomes mushy. The most important part about this sauce is it keeps getting smaller and smaller before it's completely mushy. After it's completely mushy and mushy it will have to get in the way or your pasta will dry out before you've added it. This is best done before going to bed and will keep the sauce a bit moist.

To make you creamy and filling and filling all at the same time, my own method of preparation using cilantro is to use 1/2 cup cilantro and 1/2 cup basil. I usually add a lot of salt to my sauce in this recipe, but usually not more than that if I really need to.
