Place the pasta ingredients all on the sheet in a plate. Toss well with the hot sauce and leave 1 cup to simmer. When the pasta is ready, heat a medium sized food processor. Process one or 2 cups of the pasta until pasta is thoroughly mixed. If using extra large plates, place in an airtight container to keep them moist. Toss in the red pepper flakes then stir to combine, stirring well to combine the food processor and pasta. Season the sauce to taste. Adjust the seasoning using a spoon. Serve. Notes 1. We do not recommend removing the meat when using the pasta. It can result in a bit of heat. Please note that while cooked it may not cook quickly, so be VERY sure the pasta is very well cleaned! **You can also add a tablespoon of ground cayenne pepper or just a pinch of minced red pepper flakes to the sauce. Serve with a small glass of wine! Nutrition information
