        "This notebook is used for training our own custom NLP cooking model. This is done using run_experiments.sh, run_lm_finetuning.py, and TrainingData.txt. Note that this notebook does not work in a general Jupyter Notebook environment. Rather, Google Colab was used to run this notebook and train the model. It was currently trained with a batch size of 1 over 3 epochs on my GPU, which lasted a very long time to train. With access to more advanced hardware, it might be possible to increase batch size and number of epochs, leading to an even more skillful model."
